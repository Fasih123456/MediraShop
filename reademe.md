Project Details: Merida Shop

    Our website works as a user-centric online shopping system, where the users are both the sellers and the buyers.

This makes the website act more as a medium of exchange rather than a store on its own. In order to accommodate this our
website offers a whole host of features including different types of users. When a user first registers, they are given
the option to select whether they are a buyer or a seller. From there, sellers will be given the option to post new
products and edit any existing product post that is theirs. Everyone is given the opportunity to buy products. Once
logged in they are directed to the main homepage which offers the ability to search for products using the search
bar and or with the filter drop down menu. From the navigation bar they may also select to view their profile or logout.
On the homepage each product is given a small panel from which a user can see an image, name and price of the item and
if they would like to purchase it they can click the shopping cart button. This directs them to the product-view page
where they can see more information about the product. Here they can choose to purchase the product. If the user
does not have a card linked to their account, they will be brought to the card page where they can add a new card to their account.
Once a card is added, or if a card already exists, the user will be brought to a checkout page where they can review the item
and click submit, which will then return them to the homepage.
